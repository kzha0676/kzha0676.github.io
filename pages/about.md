Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

Through the many businesses I've started, there was a commonality between all of them: data. Data is what helps us make decisions from our routine day-to-day task to the executive level decisions. Seeing the importance of data motivated me to pursue a career as a data analyst. Thus, I can utilize my skills in SQL, Excel, PowerBI, and Tableau to make informed decisions.

I grew up in an underprivileged community, where I was unsure whether I would have water for a shower the next day. However, I had the opportunity to attend the University of Texas at Austin as a first-generation student. During my time there, I took on leadership positions that allowed me to become a mentor to others, where I developed a passion for helping and mentoring. I am now a recent graduate from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Management Information Systems. Through my coursework, extracurricular involvement, and campus resources, I have become more culturally aware and have grown in various ways.
