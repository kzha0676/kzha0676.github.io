- title: Undergraduate, University of Texas at Austin, BBA
  from: 2019
  to: 2023
  description: I graduated with a degree in Management Information Systems (MIS), 
               where I developed skills in leadership, critical thinking, and collaboration. 
               
               As a first-generation student, I embraced opportunities to grow 
               through involvement in the Vietnamese Student Association (VSA), 
               University Leadership Network, and McCombs Success Scholars. 
               These experiences allowed me to connect with a diverse community, 
               navigate challenges, and build a foundation for success both personally 
               and professionally, making my time at UT truly transformative.
